<h1>Why we should get a cat</h1>
<h3>1. Cats are independent and low-maintenance pets.</h3>
<p>If they have cat food, water, and a litter box they can be left alone with no heartbreak when you leave for work every day. </p>
<p>You can even leave your cat alone for a full day because cats also don’t require daily exercise walks at all and they don’t 
    need your constant attention, which will let you relax sometimes.</p>
    <h3>2. Cats cost less money and time to care for</h3>
    <p>Owning a cat it’s more affordable than owning a dog because cats require less food, fewer toys, and almost no grooming costs.</p>
    <p>Adoption fees are usually smaller for cats and kittens, especially during the hot months when shelters tend to get overflowed with kittens.</p>
    <p>Cats toys are cheaper and very easy to do at home yourself, plus they would rather sit in a box than in a bed.</p>
    <p>DIY cat toys include old cables, hair ties, scrunched-up paper, and bottle caps.</p>
