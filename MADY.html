            <div class="column"><h2>Pros Of Owning A Cat</h2>
                <h3>1. Cats are independent and low-maintenance pets.</h3>
                    <p>If they have cat food, water, and a litter box they can be left alone with no heartbreak when you leave for work every day. You can even leave your cat alone for a full day because cats also don’t require daily exercise walks at all and they don’t 
                    need your constant attention, which will let you relax sometimes.</p>
                <h3>2. Cats cost less money and time to care for</h3>
                    <p>Owning a cat it’s more affordable than owning a dog because cats require less food, fewer toys, and almost no grooming costs.
                    Adoption fees are usually smaller for cats and kittens, especially during the hot months when shelters tend to get overflowed with kittens.
                    Cats toys are cheaper and very easy to do at home yourself, plus they would rather sit in a box than in a bed.
                    DIY cat toys include old cables, hair ties, scrunched-up paper, and bottle caps.</p>
                <h3>3. Cats adapt to any place, even small apartments</h3>
                        <p>Cats require less space which teaches you how to take advantage of your space, just get them a cat tree or a
                        window perch and they will be more than happy to just sleep on it all day.
                        They adapt easily to small places, so if you give them space to climb on like some cat shelves, they will be perfectly content.</p>
                <h3>4. Cats are perfectly happy being indoor pets</h3>
                        <p>Cats are much safer inside and can be content with living indoors only as long as they have everything they need, freshwater, food, a litter tray, and toys.
                        They sleep on average about 15 hours every day, and half of their waking hours they clean themselves leaving them little time to want to venture out.</p>
                <h3>5. Cats are quiet(er)</h3>
                        <p>Cats normally meow when they are hungry and can get insistent, but even the loudest meows are still quiet compared to a dog barking.
                        Because they sleep most of the day and are quiet which makes them ideal pets if you work from home or have children sleeping during the day.
                        You will never get complaints from your neighbors that your cat meows too much because meows are cute no matter how loud they are.</p>

                <h3>6. Cats are clean</h3>
                        <p>Cats don’t need grooming or baths as they are self-grooming, saving you time, money, and energy.
                        They spend more than half of their waking hours grooming themselves, and unless they get in some kind of a dirty mess, you rarely have to bathe your cat.
                        You still have to groom your cat with a brush from time to time, even if it’s short-haired.</p>
                <h3>7. Cats don’t need any training</h3>
                    <p>Felines are already potty trained by their mother by the time they are weaned
                    In case they don’t learn their potty habits from their mother, a pure instinct will kick in once they get into a litter box since kittenhood,
                    so there is no need to take them out for ‘bathroom’ walks multiple times per day.</p>
                        Cats do their needs alone, no need for waiting around, you just need to clean their litter box once every few days.
                        Once your cat is potty trained she can stay at home unsupervised for hours and you won’t come home to find any “accidents”.</p>
                <h3>8. Cats are efficient pest control managers</h3>
                        <p>Cats are natural-born predators and they like to hunt anything that moves, from small insects to rodents, and even your toes under the blanket.
                        They provide protection to your house killing any flies, moths, spiders, bugs, and mice.
                        Cats make cute chirping noises when stalking flies and bugs, these sounds are excitement noises that are guaranteed to make you laugh.</p>
                <h3>9. Cats have longer lifespans</h3>
                        <p>Losing a pet is heartbreaking, but compared to other pets cats have a longer life expectancy with an average of 12 years of life which is somehow comforting.</p>
                <h3>10. Cats improve your mental health</h3>
                        <p>Just petting a cat will make your brain release endorphins which will make you instantly happier, and bring down your stress levels, heart rate, and blood pressure.
                        A cat’s purr is therapeutic and comforting, lowers stress and anxiety, and offers a calming effect even for people that have sleeping problems. Cats help cope with loneliness in people that struggle with opening up to others, letting them feel the unconditional love they need but have a hard time receiving from other people.</p>

                            <h2>Cons Of Owning A Cat</h2>
                <h3>1. They Shed a Lot</h3>
                    <p>If you choose to bring a cat into your home, be prepared for its hair to get everywhere, including your furniture, carpet, clothes, tables, and countertops. Once you adopt a cat, your cleaning schedule may need some tweaking.</p>
                <h3>2. Their Litter Boxes Smell and Require Cleaning</h3>
                    <p>Cats poop is stinky, and their toilet is a litter box, so it doesn't flush. If you want a cat, you need to be able to live with this. Be prepared to clean out the litter box regularly. Depending on their habits, outside cats may require less frequent litter changes.</p>
                <h3>3. They May Claw Your Furniture to Shreds</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can get your cat a scratching post and try any number of methods to dissuade them from scratching the things you care about, but your furniture will probably get a little bit damaged.</p>
                <h3>4. They Are Very Vocal When They Want to Go In or Out</h3>
                    <p>When your cat is inside, it will meow until you let it out. When it's outside, it will meow to be let back in. Unless you have a cat-flap, expect to be on doorman duty multiple times each day. In some cases, you might stand there for ages waiting for the cat to decide where it wants to be. This is less of an issue for those with indoor-only cats.</p>
                <h3>5. Their Veterinary Bills Can Be Very Expensive</h3>
                    <p>If your cat gets sick or injured, you'll have to take them to the vet, and regular checkups are also a must. This will usually cost a lot of money.</p>
                <h3>6. They Are Natural-Born Killers</h3>
                    <p>Expect the bird population in your neighborhood to plummet if you let your cat outside. There's also a decent chance your ferocious feline will bring dead mice and lizards into your home. Are you prepared to accept these morbid gifts? Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want.</p>

                    <h3>7. They Are Strong-Willed and Rarely Obey Commands</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever heard the expression "it's like herding cats?" Unlike dogs, most of which can be easily trained, cats usually have a will of their own and don't tend to listen to orders or commands.</p>
                <h3>8. They Will Vomit Occasionally</h3>
                    <p>Cats sometimes get sick, and you're the one who has to clean it up. Cats vomit for a number of reasons. Most of the time it's hairball-related. Sometimes it's because they ingested or tasted something non-toxic that they really shouldn't have, or perhaps your wild kitten ran around too much after eating.</p>
                <h3>9. They May Scratch or Bite People</h3>
                    <p>In addition to scratching furniture, cats often scratch and bite people. They may do so accidentally when leaping into or out of your lap or purposefully when you do something they don't like. If you do adopt a cat, be prepared to incur the occasional bite or scratch mark.</p>
                <h3>10. They May Wake You Up While You're Sleeping</h3>
                    <p>Cats' sleep schedules are unusual—they may wake you up late in the night or early in the morning. Cats don't seem to care for people sleeping when they are not. If you bring one into your home, be prepared for some rude awakenings.</p>
